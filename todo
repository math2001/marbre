- tree to expression
- render tree
- 1 2 should yield an error?
- support float
- error on unmatched brackets
- collect terms is buggy (a+b+b) gives a(1+1+1)
- queue should wrap around :^) Not useful but fun

DONE:

- implement some test system. This is horrible
- split index.js
- 3a should mean 3 * a
- simplify the -1 thing
- switch to typescript
