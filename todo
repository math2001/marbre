- tree equal (different than object equal)
- collect terms is buggy (a+b+b) gives a(1+1+1)
- render tree
- 1 2 should yield an error?
- support float (fractions?)
- error on unmatched brackets
- maybe support --1 = 1?
- add name to table row for testing

DONE:

- implement some test system. This is horrible
- split index.js
- 3a should mean 3 * a
- simplify the -1 thing
- switch to typescript
- queue should wrap around :^) Not useful but fun
- tree to expression
- rename Node interface
- rename Node.leftNode
- create an alias for Node | number | string
